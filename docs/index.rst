Welcome to Django Rocket Engine, Django on AppEngine project documentation.

Motivation to create this project was the publication by Google of the CloudSQL
backend. This library as-is is not for production ready yet, the same as Google
AppEngine CloudSQL itself is not yet ready for production and is currently in
development preview.

This project was originally inspired by the work of Waldemar Kornewald and Thomas Wanschik
from `All Buttons Pressed <http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/>`_, some ideas where moved from
`djangoappengine
<http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine>`_ project.

The project is still in an experimental stage, source code can be found on `github
<https://github.com/xando/django-rocket-engine>`_.
