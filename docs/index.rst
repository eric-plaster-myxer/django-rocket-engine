Welcome to django-rocket-engine, Django on AppEngine project documentation.

Project  is a  helper library  with main  goal to  help setup  "correct" (in subjective meaning) Django development environment for Google AppEngine services.

Supports:

  * basic support for pip style requirements,
  * support for virtualenv environments,
  * pre/post deployment hooks,
  * seamless BlobStorage backend.


The project is still in an experimental stage, being more like prof-of-concept.
Source code can be found on `github <https://github.com/xando/django-rocket-engine>`_.

This project was inspired by the work of Waldemar Kornewald and Thomas Wanschik
from `All Buttons Pressed <http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/>`_, some ideas where moved from `djangoappengine <http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine>`_ project.
